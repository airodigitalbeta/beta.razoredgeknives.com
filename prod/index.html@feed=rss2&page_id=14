		<description><![CDATA[Praise the Lord... I finally found someone to sharpen my scissors!  I&#039;m a professional window treatment gal and had to keep buying scissors because they got dull &#038; didn&#039;t know where to take them.  Fabric shops will sometimes have a &quot;free-lance&quot; sharpener there for a day or two but I always missed my opportunity.  Finally found Joshua on the internet &#038; was amazed he was in such close proximity &#038; the drop-off &#038; pick-up system he has with the UPS store worked great for me.  And boy when he says &#039;razor sharp&quot; he means it!   These scissors are sharper than they ever were.  My favorite pair are from Cutco &#038; I paid dearly for them but absent-mindedly tried to cut through a pin...... totally ruined the cutting edge!  I was so distraught since I had only had them a short while.  I am soooo grateful for Josh&#039;s precision sharpening.  Thank you Joshua!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to say that Josh put an incredible mirror edge on my Schrade SCH42, and I had it back in my greedy hands in two days flat! I then added a set of custom Micarta scales, which brought a budget knife into a “custom knife” state of being. Thanks again Josh for the quick and fantastic job you did on my SCH42! I’ll try sending a few pictures through your contact section.

		<description><![CDATA[It has been over 30 years that I&#039;ve owned my Wustoff-Trident cutlery set. It also has been a long time since I had such ease in using them. Folks a sharp knife is a Godsend, and the man to get them in proper order is Josh! I am so pleased with how they came back. I will be a repeat customer!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Josh was amazing to work with I found his website about 9+ months ago. Gave him a call and spoke with him for about 45 minutes about my knives and the services he offered. He took the time to answer my questions and educate me on the geometry of knives and the difference in his sharpening methods, as compared to his competitors and the difference between my different knife styles (Traditional VS Japanese). Due to an unfortunate mishap the 1st time I got my knives professionally sharpened (they were ruined and replaced by shop), I’ve been very leery when finding someone new. Through our talk and his website I felt comfortable with his services, but as life often does it got in the way and it took me almost a year to send my knives in. We sent in 3 Viking, 3 Shun, and a set of Kershaw kitchen shears. He emailed us when he received them. Called us with different sharpening options, and emailed us when they were sent back out. He also answered my 3-4 emails I had in the interim within an 8 hour period. All of the knives prior to being sent out couldn’t cut a regular sheet of printer paper. After I got them back they could all cut a piece of paper from the telephone book which is considerably thinner. Hands down the best service, I wish shipping was a little cheaper (not that he can help these cost), but I felt his prices for sharpening considering the turnaround and quality are very fair. Try Josh’s services out, you won’t be disappointed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had Josh Cerakote and re-profile (w/ Wicked Edge) sharpen my Gerber bowie knife.  The blade was dull and rusty.  He was able to bring it back to life.  I was very impressed and pleased!  Josh is easy to work with and is very communicative and responsive whether by email, phone, or text messaging.  I will certainly turn to him for future jobs.  His prices are also very reasonable when compared to other companies, I did shop around.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just   got   back   my   Strider   Karambit   from     Josh.   This    knife   was   used   hard   and   had   only   been    sharpened   with   a    file.    Blades    were   in   Bad    Shape.    Josh   brought  the   Knife  back  to   life.  Thank you          Josh]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have dealt with other online sharpening services in the past with mixed results.
Not so with Razor Edge Knives; my favorite Buck skinning knife was returned quickly and with an edge that is superior to any I&#039;ve seen.  Their customer service  is second to none.  It was a pleasure doing business with Josh and I will recommend REK to all of my friends.  Continued success and thank you again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I dealt with Josh for the entire process. The experience was wonderfully smooth. I mailed my straight razor on 3 April, it arrived at REK the next day. After mailing it i realized that i had failed to pay for return shipping. I emailed Josh and let him know that I had forgotten to do so and he informed me that he would just add the cost of shipping to the cost of the honeing. One day later he had mailed it back to me and emailed me before and after pictures of my blade&#039;s edge. Todazy is 7 April and I am waiting on the USPS to deliver the razor today. I would highly reccomend Josh and REK for anyone looking to sharpen any blade they have.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow!  What a great service!  Josh is very customer service oriented and so easy to work with.  Dropped off my Wusthof knives on Friday and got them back on Monday.  He sharpened all the knives in the set including the santoku and the bread knife and all of them can back perfectly sharpened.  Also sent a set of 6 Chicago Cutlery steak knives and those turned out beautifully as well.   Be warned, when your knives come back they are VERY SHARP!  I cut my finger the first five minutes I used them!  Just wasn&#039;t used to having such sharp knives!  I will be sending my knives back to Josh the moment they get dull again.  Thanks again for a job well done!  Gail D]]></description>
