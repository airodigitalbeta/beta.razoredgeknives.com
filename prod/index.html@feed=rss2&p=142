		<description><![CDATA[1. Yes it would be a push cut but generally for pruning ppl do a low grit finish and finish on a leather belt w/ compound because it does not have to be a &#039;delicate&#039; cut, you are just chopping off limbs. I wouldn&#039;t put too much into it...

2. No, at least in my experience they stay sharp longer. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cliffstamp.com/knives/articles/grits.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;some work by Cliff Stamp&lt;/a&gt; also shows that a toothy/low grit edge holds it&#039;s edge retention much longer than a high grit edge when cutting soft materials. But generally there are several other factors about geometry that I would optimize before worrying about a high/low polish. The thing I don&#039;t like about mirrored edges (which I do a lot of) are that they lose their hair whittling sharpness quickly and &#039;settle in&#039; but it&#039;s simply not worth the time or $ to do this imho. 

Hope this helps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I have two questions:
1) would a pruner be &quot;pushing&quot; cut? In that case, if all what I have to sharpen is a DMT Diafold double, coarse/fine, would it be ok if after the fine side I finish with a fine ceramic stab from lansky?
Or do I necessarily need to demount the pruner and use a water stone (which I will just never do because I am lazy and lacking time)?
2) would, generally speaking, a toothy edge not become dull quickly? This test of Mike, was on short or long term? Because, yeah, you can sharpen coarse and see miracle now, but what in two days?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all the valuable information on this website. What do you consider a good final sharpening grit on a mandoline blade? I mostly use it for professional kitchen work on vegetables. Since it is pushing cutting, would I encounter the least resistance on a higher grit stone? Thanks]]></description>
