		<description><![CDATA[Praise the Lord... I finally found someone to sharpen my scissors!  I&#039;m a professional window treatment gal and had to keep buying scissors because they got dull &#038; didn&#039;t know where to take them.  Fabric shops will sometimes have a &quot;free-lance&quot; sharpener there for a day or two but I always missed my opportunity.  Finally found Joshua on the internet &#038; was amazed he was in such close proximity &#038; the drop-off &#038; pick-up system he has with the UPS store worked great for me.  And boy when he says &#039;razor sharp&quot; he means it!   These scissors are sharper than they ever were.  My favorite pair are from Cutco &#038; I paid dearly for them but absent-mindedly tried to cut through a pin...... totally ruined the cutting edge!  I was so distraught since I had only had them a short while.  I am soooo grateful for Josh&#039;s precision sharpening.  Thank you Joshua!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a repeat customer I am always amazed at the sharpness, price, and quick turnaround time of REK. 
I looked up the definition of &quot;scary sharp&quot; in the dictionary but instead of words, there was a picture of Josh.
Thanks again and keep up the excellent work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like ceramic vs. the smooth steel because it actually removes a little amount of metal each time you use it, creating a fresh apex instead of just bending it back and forth like a smooth steel does. The key is to use it alternating strokes w/ very light pressure until your edge is sharp again. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this article, I&#039;ve been getting deeper into sharpening and I appreciate the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; info here.  What kind of honing rod do you recommend?  Steel? Ceramic?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. Yes it would be a push cut but generally for pruning ppl do a low grit finish and finish on a leather belt w/ compound because it does not have to be a &#039;delicate&#039; cut, you are just chopping off limbs. I wouldn&#039;t put too much into it...

2. No, at least in my experience they stay sharp longer. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cliffstamp.com/knives/articles/grits.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;some work by Cliff Stamp&lt;/a&gt; also shows that a toothy/low grit edge holds it&#039;s edge retention much longer than a high grit edge when cutting soft materials. But generally there are several other factors about geometry that I would optimize before worrying about a high/low polish. The thing I don&#039;t like about mirrored edges (which I do a lot of) are that they lose their hair whittling sharpness quickly and &#039;settle in&#039; but it&#039;s simply not worth the time or $ to do this imho. 

Hope this helps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I have two questions:
1) would a pruner be &quot;pushing&quot; cut? In that case, if all what I have to sharpen is a DMT Diafold double, coarse/fine, would it be ok if after the fine side I finish with a fine ceramic stab from lansky?
Or do I necessarily need to demount the pruner and use a water stone (which I will just never do because I am lazy and lacking time)?
2) would, generally speaking, a toothy edge not become dull quickly? This test of Mike, was on short or long term? Because, yeah, you can sharpen coarse and see miracle now, but what in two days?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just got the knives and straight razor back and I am extremely impressed.  Al three blades are works of art, and this morning I had the best shave I&#039;ve had in a long time.  Completely satisfied, and I will tell all my friends about you.  Communications throughout was superb.  Highly recommended!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to say that Josh put an incredible mirror edge on my Schrade SCH42, and I had it back in my greedy hands in two days flat! I then added a set of custom Micarta scales, which brought a budget knife into a “custom knife” state of being. Thanks again Josh for the quick and fantastic job you did on my SCH42! I’ll try sending a few pictures through your contact section.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had Josh sharpen over 35 high end folders and some fixed blade knives.  I&#039;ve used many sharpening methods and other sharpening services in the past.  
His work is beyond excellent.  He has sharpened, reground, and put mirror finishes on my knives.  The work is so good it&#039;s almost a crime to use the knives!
They come back so sharp and beautiful it makes you want to display and show them off.
His prices are fair and his return time is fast.
I highly recommend using his services to keep your knives super sharp and if you want a knife to show off, send him some to mirror finish.  You&#039;ll amaze your fellow knife nut friends.
And finally, this young man is a hard-working, honorable family man.  A true American success story.]]></description>
