		<description><![CDATA[I just got the knives and straight razor back and I am extremely impressed.  Al three blades are works of art, and this morning I had the best shave I&#039;ve had in a long time.  Completely satisfied, and I will tell all my friends about you.  Communications throughout was superb.  Highly recommended!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just got the knives and scissors back and I am extremely happy with the outcome.  The knives are beautifully done and well worth the money spent.  In addition Josh did not have the setup to do left hand scissors nor a convex edge so instead of just half assing it like many people will do he just stated he could not do them and recommended someone who could.  That is treating your customers as they should be.  Thank you Josh for your work and friendly communications.  I will definitely use your services again and will point my friends in your direction.

Thanks,
Jonathan]]></description>
