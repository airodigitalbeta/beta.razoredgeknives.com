				<h1>Cerakote</h1>

				<p>Razor Edge Knives LLC is a FFL holder and a Cerakote applicator in the Upstate of SC. We also offer Knife & Firearm Cerakoting online through our mail-in Cerakote Service.</p>

				<p>Are you NIC certified? No, we are not NIC certified, but all that training does is offer tips and tricks on the process itself; note that certified Cerakote applicators still follow the application manual. The application is straight forward and prep is key. We take the utmost care in both the prep and painting of your firearm or knife. We have done the research and invested in the proper equipment (which costs a few thousand dollars) to complete the job in an excellent fashion – one that you should be well pleased with.</p>

				<p>So what is Cerakote? Well, chances are if you are on this page you already know what it is as well as it’s benefits. Please check out a few of the videos below for a detailed comparison between Cerakote, Gunkote, Durakote, etc. ” Cerakote is a ceramic based finish that can be applied to metals, plastics, polymers and wood. The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the foreforont of the ceramic coatings market. Cerakote ceramic coatings utilize state-of-the-art technology to out-perform any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications.” (NIC Industries)</p>

				<p>We have painstakingly researched the proper setup and procedure to ensure the absolute BEST Cerakote application to provide the longest lasting, most durable finish to your pistol, rifle, or knife. As we do more items, more pictures will be uploaded to this page. Please contact us for a quote!</p>
